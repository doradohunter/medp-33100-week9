        <h1>4 Things I'm Doing To Celebrate Halloween</h1>
        <h2>(as a 20-something with no friends)</h2>
        <div class="1">
            <h3>1. Watching Disney Halloween Movies</h3>
            <p>I'm only watching real cinema this All Hallows' Eve, like Twitches, and Twitches Too.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="2">
            <h3>2. Play Slay the Princess â€” The Pristine Cut</h3>
            <p>"Whatever horrors you may find in these dark spaces, have heart and see them through. There are no
                premature endings. There are no wrong decisions. There are only fresh perspectives and new beginnings.
                This is a love story." - The first thing you read when starting a new game</p>
        </div>
        <div class="3">
            <h3>3. Watch Into the Woods (Again)</h3>
            <p>You may think that this doesn't count but watching "Hello Little Girl" fills me with fear that horror
                movies dream they can achieve.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="4">
            <h3>4. Make Halloween Mocktails</h3>
            <p>"Mocktails? Why not actual cocktails?" You say. I'm not an alcohol person. Also, who wants to get drunk
                on a Thursday night? I have a quiz tomorrow.</p>

            <h1>🎃 The History of Halloween 🎃</h1>
            <p>Halloween has a spooky, magical past that's been celebrated for centuries. Let's uncover some fun
                history!</p>

            <section>
                <h2>🌙 Ancient Origins 🌙</h2>
                <p>It all started over 2,000 years ago with the ancient Celtic festival of <strong>Samhain</strong>, a
                    time when people celebrated the end of the harvest and the beginning of winter.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>👻 Spirits and Costumes 👻</h2>
                <p>The Celts believed that on the night of October 31, the boundary between the living and the dead
                    became blurred, and ghosts could walk among us! People wore costumes to disguise themselves and ward
                    off any wandering spirits.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>🎩 Trick-or-Treating 🎩</h2>
                <p>The tradition of trick-or-treating dates back to medieval Europe, where people would go "souling,"
                    offering prayers in exchange for treats. This evolved into our modern tradition of going
                    door-to-door for candy!</p>

            <section>
                <h2>🕯️ The Jack-O'-Lantern 🕯️</h2>
                <p>Jack-o'-lanterns were inspired by an Irish folktale about "Stingy Jack," who tricked the Devil and
                    was left to wander with only a burning coal in a hollowed-out turnip. Today, we use pumpkins for our
                    spooky lanterns!</p>
